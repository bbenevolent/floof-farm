We frequently attend ADGA Goat Shows, below are the shows we've attended and the ones we are looking forward to next. 

## 2024

Not all shows have been announced yet, but I expect I will be attending a similar list to last year. The exception being that I am not likely taking the trek to Kentucky for Nationals. I hope a show that was cancelled because of Nationals comes back and I'm going to try to do at least one fair. For a more complete list of District 7 ADGA Shows there is a [pinned post ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1110538625685211/posts/24662447956734280/)in the District 7 Facebook Group.
