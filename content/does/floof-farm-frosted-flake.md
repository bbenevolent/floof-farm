Floof Farm Frosted Flake leads back to my original foundation goats Taffy and Lacey, back when I didn't own a buck even. Those foundation goats are pretty narrow, but have been improved upon with who I have crossed them with since. I really like the attachments of the does on her sire's side, but the capacity isn't quite there. Here's hoping for a productive cross. 

Sire's Sire: Castle Rock Bugatti

Sire's: Franke Farm B Dalton Gun Metal

Sire's Dam: Franke Farm PN Coach

Dam's Sire: Tua Farms M Blaze N

Dam: Floof Farm It's a Bird

Dam's Dam: Floof Farm Driving Ms Paisley
