Aria scored an ++++83 as a first freshener and freshened a second time with an equally nice udder, especially considering she has only had singles. I've shown Aria a bit but she is just at height, so by the 3rd or 4th ring she starts to not make it under the stick. 

Sire: Almar Acres HS Smokin Hot *B
Dam: Hetlandcreek ILM Adagio 6*M
