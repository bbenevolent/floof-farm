**NOTE**: For 2024 Ariel is bred to [SDS Farm ZQ Big Tuna Quinn](https://floof.farm/2023/09/03/sds-farm-zq-big-tuna-quinn/) and due April 14th. Reservations available, see our [breeding schedule for more information](https://floof.farm/2024-goat-breeding-schedule/).  

Diji Farm MT Ariel is a goat we have always admired, having multiple Ariel grandchildren. We were delighted for her to come to live with us in July 2021. Along with all of her structural excellence she also brings a special sort of calm to the herd, everything is better with Ariel in charge!

Sire: Diji Farm SGW Moose Tracks
Dam: Diji Farm SGW Cindrella
