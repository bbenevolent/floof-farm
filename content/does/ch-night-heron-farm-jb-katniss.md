**NOTE**: For 2024 Katniss is bred to [SDS Farm ZQ Big Tuna Quinn](https://floof.farm/2023/09/03/sds-farm-zq-big-tuna-quinn/) and due March 23rd. Reservations available, see our [breeding schedule for more information](https://floof.farm/2024-goat-breeding-schedule/).  

Night Heron Farm JB Katniss is a beautiful doe who came to us when [R Serenity Farm](https://rserenityfarm.weebly.com/) dispersed their herd. Katniss and the rest of her line are the type of goats that get better and better with time. We have multiple Katniss daughters, granddaughters and a son in our herd. They include [Katana](https://floof.farm/2019/10/21/katana/), [Katalina](https://floof.farm/2023/04/16/r-serenity-bs-katalina/), [Katsu](https://floof.farm/2021/07/06/katsu/), [Kitty Kat](https://floof.farm/2023/10/05/r-serenity-pe-kitty-kat/) and [Indy](https://floof.farm/2023/05/02/floof-farm-tl-indigo-kat/).
