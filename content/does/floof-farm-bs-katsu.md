Katsu is flashy with her moonspots, but trust me there is even more behind the spots. She has an excellent wide rump and the same correctness of her mother and grandmother. Katsu's granddam [CH Night Heron Farm JB Katniss](https://floof.farm/2021/07/10/ch-night-heron-farm-jb-katniss/) was 9th place aged doe and 9th place dam/daughter at ADGA Nationals in 2023. Beyond Katsu's confirmation her willingness to milk is an improvement on the rest of the Kat-line. Katsu peaked at 5.0 lbs on test as a three year old first freshener in 2023 and reached her requirements for advanced registry in volume, protein and butterfat.
