Bea is one of quad doelings that I didn't get bred and were just sitting around my herd. She will be a "dreaded" 3 year old first freshener, but the reason I'm breeding her instead of her sisters is her width. A plain black goat just like her dam I often walk into the pen and think "who is that!?! and have to remember it is Bea.
