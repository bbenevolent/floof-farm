**NOTE**: For 2024 Katana is bred to [SDS Farm ZQ Big Tuna Quinn](https://floof.farm/2023/09/03/sds-farm-zq-big-tuna-quinn/) and due March 24th. Reservations available, see our [breeding schedule for more information](https://floof.farm/2024-goat-breeding-schedule/).  

R Serenity CF Katana is one of our foundation does. As a friend said “Katana was born setting herself up”. A joy to show, but never placed all that high in the junior ring. We suspect she is following in her dam Katniss’ foot steps and will be a powerhouse in a couple years. Katana is always a crowd favorite because she loves to be snuggled and to give out goat kisses.
