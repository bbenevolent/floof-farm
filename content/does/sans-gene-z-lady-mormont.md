Lady has been hiding the barn a bit since I showed her at the Washington State Fair in 2019 where she was 9th in her class. I freshened her once and showed her daughters Princess Buttercup both as a baby and a yearling. I don't expect Lady to be on my show string since she is going to be a five year old 2nd freshener, but I'm hoping for a daughter.
