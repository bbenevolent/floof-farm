Kitty Kat is part of the Kat collection here and also a daughter of [Diji Farm MT Prince Eric](https://www.adgagenetics.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D001726109). She's a tiny thing with a cute udder as a first freshener, just like her dam [R Serenity BS Katalina](https://floof.farm/2023/04/16/r-serenity-bs-katalina/). I'm really curious to see if she follows in her dam's foot steps with her second freshening.
