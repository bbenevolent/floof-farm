We brought home Taffy with her mom [Lacey](https://floof.farm/2019/10/19/lacey/) as our first goats. Since then Taffy has grown up and freshened three times and was LA'd after her first freshening with a ++V+83. I love the correctness of Taffy's front end and how easy she is to hand milk. Taffy is one of those does where she really has improved with age, if you see the difference in the pictures between her 3rd freshening and 1st freshening you'll understand. 

Sire: Castle Rock Sun-Ray
Dam: [Diji Bryedal Lace](https://floof.farm/2019/10/19/lacey/)
