**For Sale $300 in milk**

Parker got her name because she consistently jumped out of the kid pen to steal grain from the milk stand as a baby. She also jumped over the 4 foot gate at one point. Fortunately she seems to have grown out of some of her jumpy ways.

Parker's sire is the well known Embolden who was on the elite list in both 2021 (88%) and 2022 (90%).
