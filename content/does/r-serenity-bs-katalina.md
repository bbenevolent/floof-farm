**NOTE**: For 2024 Katalina is bred to [SDS Farm ZQ Big Tuna Quinn](https://floof.farm/2023/09/03/sds-farm-zq-big-tuna-quinn/) and due March 23rd. Reservations available, see our [breeding schedule for more information](https://floof.farm/2024-goat-breeding-schedule/).  

R Serenity BS Katalina is what we look for in a Nigerian Dwarf Goat. She combines an excellent mammary in a small stature (tiny for even a Nigerian Doe). I had the opportunity to admire Katalina for many years before she came to Floof Farm with her daughter [R Serenity PE Kitty Kat](https://floof.farm/2023/10/05/r-serenity-pe-kitty-kat/).

Katalina is well on her way to her CH, she kidded very late (May 30th) my first year with her on my show string. It looks like she has settled for a much earlier date in 2024, so I hope to get her out much more.  Kat goats are my favorite line and she is as nice/if not an improvement on her dam's udder. In 2022 Katalina earned her milk star in protein and butterfat, she will continue to be on test at our farm. 

Katalina is dam to [R Serenity CF Painted Kat](http://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D002012788) "Mavis" who is as lovely as her dam. One of the excellent things about the Kats is their consistency in confirmation and udder. She also has a few bucks out there doing nice things in herds including [Patient Hope Farm](https://www.patienthopefarm.com/camo) and [Waldi Lane Farm](https://www.waldilane.com/).
