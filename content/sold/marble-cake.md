Marble or "Marbs" as she is often called is one of the last "Frank Daughters" a buck beloved by many. Shown as a dry yearling and then freshened in 2020. Apparently with covid and all I didn't take many pictures. She had a very nice tucked up udder and I'm excited to freshen her again for 2022.  

Dam: Sans Gene GT Cupcake
