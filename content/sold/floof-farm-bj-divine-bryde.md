Note: Diva has moved to a 4-H home. 

Diva is one of the very first goats born here out of the very first goat we purchased [Diji Bryedal Lace](https://floof.farm/2019/10/19/lacey/). Now a third freshener she live to milk with decent production for a small goat.  The main thing I love conformationally about Diva is her buttery udder that is a delight to hand milk. For me teat size is important, but the texture and orfice size even more so, that is where Diva shines.
