Dalton has 4 SG does in a row on his dam's side and excellent confirmation on his sire's. He has sired a couple does we have kept, but have not yet freshened. Dalton's sister [Charlie](https://floof.farm/2023/06/13/franke-farm-b-charlie-caryall-2/) is a three year old first freshener here this year and recently appraised a VVVG84.

Dalton is currently looking for a new herd to make an impact on. 

Sire: Castle Rock Bugatti *B VEE90
Dam: SG Franke Farm PN Coach 8*M +VEV85
