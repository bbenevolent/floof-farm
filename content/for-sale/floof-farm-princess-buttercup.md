Princess Buttercup aka PB is a farm favorite. If her favorite person yells "PB, PB" she calls back and comes running. Not only does she have a sterling personality, but she is also a stylish doe. I like the way she carries herself, her width (thanks Sans Gene!) and her dairy strength in particular. 

Sire: Diji Farm MT Prince Eric
Dam: Sans Gene Z Lady Mormont
