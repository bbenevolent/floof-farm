In our quest to get down to 30 goats overall I need to over a few does for sale. 

[Floof Farm Princess Buttercup](https://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D002240651) ($450): PB freshened in spring 2024 with a single. She is trained to milk by hand and machine. PB is bred to [Hanson Hideaway JZ Tamales](https://floof.farm/2024/07/06/hanson-hideaway-jz-hot-tamales/) and is due March 11th. She ultrasounded showing 2 or 3 kids. She earned a milk star in butterfat last year and I expect her to easily earn one in volume and protein, I dropped down to 1x a day milking and then dried up my of my herd. 

PB does have a couple scurs on her head and one can get about an inch long, she does knock it off sometimes.
