Here we will list any goats kids for sale that are generally available and don't have a reservation. I update this page frequently. Kids are listed here until either a deposit is received or they have left the farm. [My sales policy is pretty simple](https://floof.farm/sales-policy/) and publicly available. Pick-up is assumed on my farm in Winlock, WA unless other arrangements are made. 

Any questions about any of the kids? I can be reached via:
Phone: 360-480-5261 (please text first, I won't answer random phone calls)
Email: k8chapman@gmail.com 
Facebook: [Floof Farm](https://www.facebook.com/theflooffarm) (preferred)

Pet boys are $75 on a bottle or $125 at weaning. At weaning they will be banded (castrated), have their vaccines and are disbudded.

## Rosa's Adorable Daughter! Born April 4th 2024

Rosa a promising first freshener, she milked over 3 lbs on her first milk test. I haven't even made Rosa a page here. I'd keep this one but I have too many goats at the moment to keep more than just a couple kids this year. Snatch this cutie up before I change my mind $250 and can come with registration.
