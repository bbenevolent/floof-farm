The 2nd week of July I'm headed to SoCal to pick-up a new addition. I can either drive both ways or fly down and drive back. Interested in a Floof Farm goat? Help me make the decision for me. 

Note: Updated June 21st, I will be adding goats as I take pictures and get organized. 

## Kids

**[Floof Farm BTQ Sally Lightfoot](https://genetics.adga.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D002326988&DamNum=D002116646)** 3/28/2024: Lighty is one of only TWO doelings born from our new buck [SDS Farm ZQ Big Tuna Quinn](https://floof.farm/2023/09/03/sds-farm-zq-big-tuna-quinn/). Tuna has a packed pedigree including his sire Agape’s Prize Lennzipp C Quinn *B.  [Wild in Wild D Lay Down Sally](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/wild-in-wild-d-lay-down-sally/) her dam isn't too bad herself linking back to Nigerian Dwarf volume record holder Zuzanna. Sally has been milking consistently over 4lbs on milk test and has the best teats and placement of any goats in our herd. 

[Floof Farm IK Glamorous Gal](https://genetics.adga.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D002321325&DamNum=D002201058) 3/31/2024: Gal brings together some of the bests part of Floof Farm's genetics. Her sire is Floof Farm IK Indigo Kat a promising young buck with the lovely [Katniss](https://floof.farm/2021/07/10/ch-night-heron-farm-jb-katniss/) as his dam and his dam in Floof Farm PE Pretty Princess who is a first freshener with a buttery udder. Princess' lines have staying power with her granddam Springwater HKY Shes Beautiful finishing recently as an EIGHT YEAR OLD!

[Floof Farm TL Dame Waverly](https://genetics.adga.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D001897893&DamNum=D002240651) 3/29/2024: Are you looking for booty? Waverly has it! [Sans Gene](https://www.sansgenegoats.com/) is known for breeding for width and that is what we have here. Her dam milked a respectable 2.9 lbs on her last milk test, not bad for a goat that had a single and is a first freshener. 

## Dry Yearlings

I thought I was going to be able to freshen these ladies in 2025, but well....goat math. My loss is your gain as I've grown them out and they are ready for breeding. 

[Floof Farm KMD Fiona](https://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D002295732) what I love most about Fiona is her length. Named Fiona because she reminds me of a deer she should also have great milk production from her sire's side. 

[Floof Farm TL Haute Culture](https://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D002322632) it pains me to let Tie daughters go, but I just have too many. He puts wide glorious rumps on all his daughters, so I tend to cross him with some of my more refined does. The result in HC is no different. Her dam in the Franke Farm B Charlie Caryall a lovely little doe coming from many generations of SG. 

## Milkers

I'm still trying to sort through all the first fresheners I have. Most were sired by Prince Eric who was lost last year. Eric was littermates to our herd queen Ariel. Almost all his daughters are milking about 3 lbs on test as first fresheners. They have great texture and teat size for hand milking. His 2nd freshening daughter had a big jump in production in her second freshening and I expect the same for these ladies. 

## Bucks

[Floof Farm DG Damascus](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/damascus/)(polled) a very nice boy that isn't getting used like I would like here. I have brought in some outside bucks and didn't end up using him last year.[ Katana](https://floof.farm/2019/10/21/r-serenity-cf-katana/) is Dami's dam and part of the 9th placed Produce of Dam entry at Nationals last year. 

[Floof Farm TL Katsuta](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/floof-farm-tl-katsuta/) (polled): Another Tie kid here! I'm offering Katsuta because I liked the Katsu/Tie cross so much that I kept his full sister [Koto](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/floof-farm-tl-katsu-koto/). Koto has been shown 1x this year and was placing in the top few of the dry yearling class. Katsu (dam) consistently milks over 4 lbs on test, most recently 4.4 lbs and peaked at 5 lbs last year.
