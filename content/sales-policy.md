Our goat sales policy is designed to set expectations you can depend on from us as sellers and what we expect from you as buyers. 

## Reservations

Reservations on kids are free. [Contact us](https://floof.farm/contact/) to get on our reservation list with your preferred breedings. We will do our best to fill it however we have first choice on all breedings. Once the kids have been evaluated those with reservations will be contacted with availability and prices. Within 48 hours of being notified, we will need a commitment and a deposit of half the purchase price is due within 4 days. Animals must be paid in full before being transported.

We have the first right to retain any kid born, change any planned breeding at any time as well as terminate a sale at anytime with a a full refund. Buyer is responsible for all transport and costs unless otherwise negotiated

## When can kids go home?

Our kids are [mostly bottle raised now.](https://floof.farm/2023/10/22/how-we-raise-goat-kids-currently/) Kids can go home as early as 2 weeks and we prefer they leave before 6 weeks. Under special circumstances we can keep them until weaning, they are priced by how long they stay here as bottle raising is quite a bit of work.

## Guarantees 

Once a goat leaves our property, we are not responsible for the health of the goat unless in case of genetic defect. In that case, we require a letter from a licensed veterinarian at the buyers expense before a replacement is given. The animal or papers on the animal must be returned to the farm before a replacement animal will be given. There will be no monetary refund.

## What we do before a goat leaves

We disbud all of our horned kids. Kids are started on a coccidiostat at 1 week old. Dams have received their CDT shot 30 days before kidding unless otherwise noted. We do not band wethers until they are 12 weeks of age, so if you are getting bottle boys as pets consider how you will have them castrated. 

## Other considerations

Goats are herd animals and need another goat to live with so if you purchase a doe and have no other goats we will sell you a wether as a buddy at a discount.

Discounts and preference to herds that currently participate in showing, Linear Appraisals, Milk tests, 4-H and multiple purchases.
