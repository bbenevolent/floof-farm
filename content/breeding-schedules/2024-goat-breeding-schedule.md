Our dairy goat breeding schedule is a work in progress until kids are born. As always reservations are free and other details are outlined in [my simple sales policy](https://floof.farm/sales-policy/). Feel free to [contact me by email](https://floof.farm/contact/) or [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theflooffarm) if there is a pairing you are interested in. Pick-up is at our farm in Winlock, WA unless other arrangements are made.

My prices vary depending on the quality of the parents, the quality of the offspring and also if the goat is going to a performance home. Home milkers start at $250 without papers and competitive show kids with champion parents are $1000, everyone else is somewhere in between with the typical price of a papered doe being $400. The exception to this is wethers which are $150, discounted to $100 if picked up before they are four weeks old or purchased in groups of three or more.
