Our dairy goat breeding schedule is a work in progress until kids are born. We register our dairy goats with ADGA and breed Nigerian Dwarf goats and Toggenburg goats.

I accept reservations at anytime in the year and they are free. More information on reservations is outlined in [my simple sales policy](https://floof.farm/sales-policy/). You can make a reservation or ask questions [by email](https://floof.farm/contact/) or [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theflooffarm). Pick-up is at our farm in Winlock, WA unless other arrangements are made.

My prices vary depending on the quality of the parents, the quality of the offspring and also if the goat is going to a performance home. Home milkers start at $250 without papers and competitive show kids with champion parents are $1300, everyone else is somewhere in between with the typical price of a papered doe being $400.

I keep a reservation list for pet wethers as well. Pick-up before 1 week is $30, before 4 weeks is $50 and at weaning is $125. Discounts for multiple wethers.
