Highest score: EEVE91
2021 score: VEEV87</td><td>Katniss has produced some lovely offspring. Including our own Katana and the highly competitive R Serenity BS Katalina who won [Grand Champion and Best Udder of Breed at the ISDGA show under Amy Akramoff](https://www.isdga.com/ring-4.html).

VVEE89</td><td>Ariel and her littermate brother Eric are the parents of multiple highly competitive juniors. 

Ariel's daughter R Serenity BS Magnolia who was Junior Grand at 2 shows this year AND 4th in her class at Nationals!

Breeding her to Blaze will add a little leg similar to her previous match-up with Old Mountain Farm Blue Steel which created Maggie.

(Polled)</td><td>[Diji Bryedal Lace](https://floof.farm/2019/10/19/lacey/)</td><td>Lacey is one of our very first goats. She's never been LA'd but I believe she would do well she has freshened on an awkward schedule in the past for LAs though. Hoping to have her back on a normal schedule for 2022</td><td>$400 - $500 does

(Polled)</td><td>Katana did okay showing this year but I did not manage her production as I should have. You can tell that from the "A" in mammary in her LA score. From watching her sister we know it takes a couple freshenings for capacity to really be there and I expect her next one to be really "wow". 
[Planned Pedigree](https://www.adgagenetics.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D002008580&DamNum=D002010646)</td><td>$500 - $600 (does and bucks)

When freshened she had a nice tucked up udder. In 2021 she was one of my "covid drys" just meaning I didn't freshen all my does. I expect great things from her in 2022.  Eric is a secret power house buck his daughter won junior BIS at the Washington State Fair in 2021.

+VVA76 
(Polled)</td><td>Paisley is an improvement on her dam adding dairy strength and capacity. Another with a low mammary score at LAs this year. I let her raise her kids and pulled them only a couple weeks before LAs 6 months into her lactation. In 2022 I plan to actually milk her and expect a rating more inline with her genetics.

She has produced a beautiful daughter and some of her relatives were quite competitive in the show ring this year. Her dam SG Springwater HKY Shes Beautiful won Sr Grand Champion at the North Idaho State Fair this year. </td><td>$400 - $500 does

She has great big orifices and teats that are easy to hand milk. I expect Jack to add body capacity to her kids.
