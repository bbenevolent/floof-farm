*This is a work in progress. Match-ups may change.* Timing of kidding is focused on Nationals in Redmond, Oregon. 

**Note**: If you are feeling impatient we still have [2022 kids for sale](https://floof.farm/2022/04/23/2022-kids-for-sale/). I've been slow on pictures and listing them. 

4 or more freshenings

<table><tbody><tr><td>Sire</td><td>Dam</td><td>Notes</td><td>Price range</td><td>Due Date/Kidding Date</td><td>Results</td></tr><tr><td>[Sans Gene BV Time Lord](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/tie/)</td><td>[CH Night Heron Farm JB Katniss](https://floof.farm/2021/07/10/ch-night-heron-farm-jb-katniss/)
Highest score: EEVE91
2021 score: VEEV87</td><td>Katniss has produced some lovely offspring. Including our own Katana and the highly competitive R Serenity BS Katalina who won [Grand Champion and Best Udder of Breed at the ISDGA show under Amy Akramoff](https://www.isdga.com/ring-4.html). 

Katniss is one of the nicest does we own, the only thing she could have a tiny bit more of is body capacity which Tie has in spades.

(Polled)</td><td>This is a repeat match-up of the breeding that created Kat Man Dude, I'm rolling again for a doeling! 

Kat Man was shown once as a junior buckling at the SWWDGA Show. He took 1st in two classes and 3rd and 4th in the others. I wasn't going to keep a buck in 2022, but he was so nice I had to. 

[Planned Pedigree](http://genetics.adga.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D002008580&DamNum=D002010646)</td><td>$600 (bucks and does)</td><td>April 24th 2023
Confirmed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>[Tua Farms M Blaze N](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/tua-farms-m-blaze-n/)</td><td>[R Serenity BS Katalina](https://floof.farm/r-serenity-bs-katalina/)
VVVV85
</td><td>I'm excited to see this combination. Blaze tends to add leg to short goats and while Katalina is small and mighty a little more size wouldn't hurt.

Is a junior I take to nationals in this pairing? I think there might be. 

[Planned Pedigree](http://genetics.adga.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D002008580&DamNum=D001929393)</td><td>$900-$1100 (bucks and does)</td><td>May 27th 2023 - Confirmed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>[Floof Farm Kat Man Dude](https://floof.farm/2022/06/15/floof-farm-kat-man-dude/)</td><td>[Diji Farm MT Ariel ](https://floof.farm/2021/07/10/diji-farm-mt-ariel/)(Polled)
VVEE89</td><td>Ariel and her littermate brother Eric are the parents of multiple highly competitive juniors. 

Ariel's daughter R Serenity BS Magnolia who was Junior Grand at 2 shows this year AND 4th in her class at Nationals in 2021!

Combining the Kat and the Ariel lines has also led to some really nice goats including Katana who is a Katniss daughter and an Ariel granddaughter. 

[Planned Pedigree](http://genetics.adga.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D002228393&DamNum=D001692779)</td><td>$800 - $1000 (bucks and does)</td><td>April 9th 2023</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr><td>Sire</td><td>Dam</td><td>Notes</td><td>Price range </td><td>Due Date/Kidding Date</td><td>Results</td></tr><tr><td>[Sans Gene BV Time Lord](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/tie/)</td><td>[R Serenity OMF Marble Cake](https://floof.farm/2019/10/21/marble-cake/)</td><td>Marble was in the middle of the placing of 4 year old does this year, but I think with some better udder management in 2023 she'll place higher.

2nd Freshenings

<table><tbody><tr><td>Sire</td><td>Dam</td><td>Notes</td><td>Price Range</td><td>Due Date/Kidding Date</td><td>Results</td></tr><tr><td>[Sans Gene BV Time Lord](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/tie/)</td><td>[Floof Farm MB Tawny Frogmouth](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/floof-farm-mb-tawny-frogmouth/)</td><td>Tawny freshened with a lovely udder very late in our kidding season. I think her fore udder might be the best on the farm. She was also very competitive in the one show I took her to as a dry yearling including a 3rd place in a very big class. Nighty is a beauty as well with classy bloodlines including his sire being half siblings to a National Champion. Excited to see what they produce. 

[Planned Pedigree](http://genetics.adga.org/PlannedPedigreePrint.aspx?SireNum=D001971027&DamNum=D002093939)</td><td>$600 does and bucklings</td><td>April 24th 2023</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>[Floof Farm Kat Man Dude](https://floof.farm/2022/06/15/floof-farm-kat-man-dude/) (Moon Spots)</td><td>[R Serenity Savanna Dry Cider](http://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D002091116) (Blue Eyes)</td><td>What to say about Savy? Her rear angulation is excellent, her topline is a beauty to behold, udder very well attached. When shown as a 2 year old she placed well, but almost every judge said she was immature. Well, she's maturing and it is exciting!

Sometimes she thought 1x a day was enough. Now that we have been milking her for months she is tame and agreeable which means we'll get a real idea of her udder next year which was very well attached and smooth in all the right places. Very excited to see her cross with Kat Man who was so beautiful he was the keeper buck I didn't know I needed.

She was so little when she was born she came out sideways. Now at about 45 pounds she freshened nicely, not our biggest producer, but some of the other does weigh 2x as much as her. We've heard about her tiny grandma from Diji and how she was slow to mature too, so continue to have high hopes for her.</td><td>$500 does

There are a couple general appearance things I'd like to improve on and I think Kat Man is up to the task!

I'm excited to cross her with the Kat line.

She was shown 1x in 2021 as a dry yearling placing 2nd in a competitive yearling class. Her 1/2 sister R Serenity BS Magnolia was Junior Grand at 2 shows this year AND 4th in her class at Nationals! Tie produces lovely kids and I'm excited to see what Katsu and he produce.

I'm expecting Coach to repeat that and pass it on to her kids.

Her dam has a lovely udder and I think her sire Tie added some body capacity. I can't wait to see how it comes together in an udder. I accidentally kept all 4 sisters from one litter so I am going to mix and match with 4 sires.

I've bred her to Blaze as he was tall enough and I'm planning to get a Togg buck this year. I expect their offspring to be adorable homestead milkers and I'm excited to show Twy-Twy in milk.</td><td>$350 does
