Sans Gene BV Time Lord aka Tie has added excellent width when bred to some of our narrower does. [Sans Gene](https://www.sansgenegoats.com/)'s breeding program prides itself in breeding for wide booties and Tie is no different in stamping this on his own offspring. Tie is extra special to us because he is the sire of the first goat ever born at Floof Farm, Paisley. Before we ever got a buck we were able to use him in a driveway breeding with [R Serenity SR Taffeta](https://floof.farm/2021/07/06/taffy/).

We bred Tie to most of the Kat's last year and retained [Floof Farm TL Katsu Koto](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/floof-farm-tl-katsu-koto/), [Floof Farm TL Indigo Kat](https://floof.farm/2023/05/02/floof-farm-tl-indigo-kat/) and [Floof Farm TL Katsuta](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/floof-farm-tl-katsuta/). This year we are crossing the Kats back with some of his sons, specifically [Floof Farm BS Katsu](https://floof.farm/2021/07/06/floof-farm-bs-katsu/) and [R Serenity PE Kitty Kat](https://floof.farm/2023/10/05/r-serenity-pe-kitty-kat/). 

In previous years we kept [Floof Farm Driving Ms Paisley](https://floof.farm/2019/10/21/paisley/) and Floof Farm TL Bea Arthur. Tie had also been bred to [R Serenity BS Katalina](https://floof.farm/2023/04/16/r-serenity-bs-katalina/) a few years ago, but she had quad bucklings which ended up being sold as wethers. We might repeat that breeding someday.
