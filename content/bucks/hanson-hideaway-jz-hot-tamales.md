When I was thinking about an outside buck for fall 2024 breeding [Hanson's Hideaway ](https://www.hansonshideaway.com/)immediately came to mind. My primary focus is on ADGA Show Goats and what better place to go to improve my lines for that purpose than Hanson's Hideaway. 

I was delighted to be able to bring Tamales home and plan to use him extensively in my breedings for 2025.
