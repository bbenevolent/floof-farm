SDS Farm ZQ Big Tuna Quinn is a lovely buckling from [Sunny Days Farm](https://sunnydaysfarmwa.weebly.com/), I especially appreciate his length and his rear angulation. This guy's pedigree is packed with champions, I first admired his sire when he was a baby being shown in the PNW.Tuna is the only goat I brought in during 2023 with the goal of having an outcross to combine with some of my Kat line, unfortunately for 2024 kidding season he only produced one doeling. I'm going to try again heavily in for 2025!

**Relatives' Noteworthy Accomplishments: **

- I first noticed Lenny (Agape's Prize Lennzipp C Quinn) as a baby when he was 1st in all three rings at the Wine County Classic in 2019. Since then he has plenty of daughers on the ground making their own splashes as well.  Lenny himself should get his Superior Genetics once ADGA is awarding them again, he currently has PTI21 of 110.

- Old Mountain Farm Cyrus Quinn is the sire of the 2024 ADGA National Champion [GCH Wolfivan CQ Ginger Root](http://www.wolfivan.com/gch-wolfivan-cq-ginger-root.html), the 2021 ADGA National Champion [CH Wood Bridge Farm 22K Gold](http://agapesprize.com/senior-does/wood-bridge-farm-22k-gold/) and the 2016 Jr. National Champion [GCH Wood Bridge Farm Pets Promise](https://bellanottefarm.com/portfolio/wood-bridge-farm-pets-promise/). He was also 2017 2nd place get of sire, 2018 1st place get of sire, 2021 Premier herdsire and on 2022 Elite list.

- Wood Bridge Farm Understated's dam (Wood Bridge Farm Belladonna) is the only doe to take home the National Championship two times!
