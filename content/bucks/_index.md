## [M Blaze N](https://adgagenetics.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D002008580)

Blaze just recently came to Floof Farm. We love his dairy strength which will blend nicely with some of our ladies. Excited to see some of his kids in Spring 2020.

## Rocky

Rocky is our wether and buck buddy. He's Marble's brother and came to our farm when we swore we would never get more than one buck!
