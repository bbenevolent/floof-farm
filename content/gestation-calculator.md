This goat gestation calculator makes it easier to figure out your goat's due date and add it to your Google calendar. For miniature breeds we calculate a **145 day** gestation and for standard breeds **150 days**. Remember these due dates are only estimates — goats, just like humans, don't tend to give birth on a schedule.

We pen breed and leash breed all our goats so we have a rough idea of when they will give birth. We like to be there for our goats when they birth just in case of complications and to ensure the babies get colostrum.

Check out our [breeding schedule](/breeding-schedules/) to see where our goats are in their gestation.
