Floof Farm is a Washington dairy goat farm based in Winlock. We breed American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA) Registered [Nigerian Dwarf](https://andda.org/) and [Toggenburg Dairy](https://www.nationaltoggclub.org/) Goats. Established in 2017 we originally started out wanting goats just for milk and welcomed our first 3 Nigerian Dwarf goats. Now we breed and sell dairy goats for competing, home milking, brush clearing, pets and fun!

In 2019 we got the show bug and began experimenting with [milk test](https://floof.farm/2023/09/16/getting-started-on-milk-test/) as well. That year we participated in our first Linear Appraisal with one doe! In 2020 we added Toggenburg wethers for fun, but then we wanted to try showing full-sized goats. So in 2021 [Twyla](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/moss-ridge-cals-twyla/) our first Toggenburg show goat joined. Now we are fully into the world of competitive goating, this included attending our first [National Show](https://nationalshow.adga.org/) in 2023. It was a pleasure to be around so many dairy goat enthusiasts in Redmond. We won't make Nationals in 2024, but have our eyes on 2025. 

Floof Farm participates in all of the American Dairy Goat Association Performance Programs. This includes [showing](https://floof.farm/goat-shows/), linear appraisals and milk test. We love teaching others what we have learned about goats and also are always trying to pick-up new skills ourselves. You can find this information on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/theflooffarm) as well as [our blog](https://floof.farm/category/blog/). Because we have benefited and continue to benefit from mentorship from others and love passing that information down. May be we can help you begin competitive goating!
