Floof Farm is a Washington dairy goat farm based in Winlock. We breed American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA) Registered [Nigerian Dwarf](https://andda.org/) and [Toggenburg Dairy](https://www.nationaltoggclub.org/) Goats. Established in 2017 we originally started out wanting goats just for milk and welcomed our first 3 Nigerian Dwarf goats. Now we breed and sell dairy goats for competing, home milking, brush clearing, pets and fun!

In 2019 we got the show bug and began experimenting with [milk test](https://floof.farm/2023/09/16/getting-started-on-milk-test/) as well. That year we participated in our first Linear Appraisal with one doe! In 2020 we added Toggenburg wethers for fun, but then we wanted to try showing full-sized goats. So in 2021 [Twyla](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/moss-ridge-cals-twyla/) our first Toggenburg show goat joined. Now we are fully into the world of competitive goating!

We attended our first [National Show](https://nationalshow.adga.org/) in 2023 in Redmond — it was a pleasure to be around so many dairy goat enthusiasts. We made it back to Nationals in 2025 and had a blast. We're skipping 2026, but we're already excited for Nationals 2027 in Salem, Oregon!

In 2025 we also welcomed our first Nubian to the herd — Rosie, won through the Rosie Raffles at the Roseburg Goat Show. A fun new addition to the Floof Farm family!

Floof Farm participates in all of the American Dairy Goat Association Performance Programs. This includes [showing](/adga-goat-shows/), linear appraisals and milk test. We love teaching others what we have learned about goats and also are always trying to pick up new skills ourselves. You can find this information on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/theflooffarm) as well as [our blog](/blog/). Because we have benefited and continue to benefit from mentorship from others and love passing that information down. Maybe we can help you begin competitive goating!
