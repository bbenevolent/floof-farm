[Franke Farm B Charlie Caryall](http://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D002081536): Charlie's dam line has 4 generations of Superior Genetics in a row. Her sire Bugatti scored at 90 (VEE) as a 4 year old.   She is a beautiful doe, I just liked this line so much I bought her and her litter mate brother [Dalton](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/dalton/). I then kept his son [Damascus](https://floof.farm/2021/07/07/damascus/).  If I could have 100 goats she probably wouldn't even be on offer. 

Sire:  [Castle Rock Bugatti](http://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D001755068) *B FS90 (VEE) 
Dam: [SG Franke Farm PN Coach](http://genetics.adga.org/GoatDetail.aspx?RegNumber=D001872092) 8*M FS85 (+VEV)

For Sale: $400.00 ($475.00 bred)
