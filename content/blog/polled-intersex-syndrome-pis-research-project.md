As part of a research project at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA, we are looking to test goats that are either confirmed or suspected as being Intersex/Hermaphrodites (not Freemartins). The aim of this research is to develop a simple and inexpensive method to detect this condition using DNA from hair samples. All donor farms/individuals will remain anonymous and the information collected will be used for research purposes only. 

For more information on Polled Intersex Syndrome, there is an [FAQ](https://floof.farm/2022/01/11/polled-intersex-syndrome-pis-f-a-q/) here.
