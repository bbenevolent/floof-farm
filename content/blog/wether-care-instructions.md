## Current Feeding

**Kalmbach Feeds Start Right Young Goat Feed
**you can get this at Chewy.com or switch them to a different medicated feed such as Purina Grower which is available at any local feedstore
You have been sent home with a small bag of Kalmbach feed that should last 3 or 4 days
Medicated goat feed is important for preventing coccidiosis. There are other ways to prevent coccidiosis, but this is what I do with my goats.
**Hay
**You have been sent home with 1 flake which should last a day or two
**Fresh clean water
Loose minerals** I use sweetlix but any loose goat mineral would be okay

### General Feeding

Goats always need access to clean, dry hay fed off the ground in a hay feeder. Local grass hay is fine, they don’t need alfalfa long term except for a treat. This is their main source of food. Even if you have lots of browse available always have a little hay available. 
**Loose Minerals:**
Goats need access to dry loose minerals that are protected from the weather
**Goat pellets:**
This is not necessary after they are 6 months old when they are less likely to get coccidiosis, they could be fed as a treat but watch for overweight goats. I like to feed my wethers a little bit of alfalfa pellets to help balance the Calcium to Phosphorous ratio in their diet
**Poisonous plants:**
Goats cannot eat all plants. It is important to keep that in mind. I don’t have a complete list of plants they can’t eat. A few key examples are Azaleas and Rhododendrons. They also can’t eat the leaves of any pit fruit such as cherry or plum trees

## Shelter

Goats don’t need fancy shelters but they do need access to a clean, dry well ventilated place to sleep. This is also a good place to keep their hay feeder and minerals to keep those items dry. When I got started I just used a 10 by 10 dog kennel with a roof and sides.
