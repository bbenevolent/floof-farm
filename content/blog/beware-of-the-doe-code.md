The [doe code](https://goatsinthegarden.blogspot.com/2009/02/doe-code-of-honor.html) is usually about kidding. Prepare for everything, but your does will figure out how, where and when to kid to thwart those plans. To me it is broader than that, make the best laid plans and your goats will figure out how to mess them up. This most recently happened with my goat [Twyla](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/moss-ridge-cals-twyla/).

I need to go out of town for work. The timing was pretty good as I wouldn't have any does kidding during that time and I could dry up most of my milkers. I wanted to keep Twyla in milk with hopes that she could earn her [milk star in volume](https://floof.farm/2023/09/16/getting-started-on-milk-test/). She went to a friend's herd so that she could keep being milked while I was gone. That friend only has goats from my herd, all of which Twyla already knew. 

Twyla is a pretty even tempered goat and I figured the change might upset her but would be fine. During the weeks she was there she almost completely dried up though. Late in lactation but she was producing over a half gallon a day when she went over.   What upset her so much? Her adopted daughter [Koto](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/floof-farm-tl-katsu-koto/) was left behind!

Twyla is back home now and very happy to be back with her bestie. We'll try again for a milk star next lactation. Next time, I won't forget the doe code.
