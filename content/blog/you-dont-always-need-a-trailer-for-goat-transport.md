Today I needed a simple solution for goat transport. I was taking one of my full-sized goats to a friend. My two options were my Honda Element or hitching up my stock trailer. I chose the Element. One of the reasons I like the Nigerian Dwarf goats is I can just use XL dog crates to haul them around. This doesn't work for the full-sized goats. The way I haul a single one is by using an X Pen and some ratchet straps. I don't know how well this will work for an anxious full-sized goat but [Twyla](https://floof.farm/2023/09/30/moss-ridge-cals-twyla/) just lays down when the car is in motion.

When I needed to transport my Togg wethers I opted for the stock trailer as they are a little more rambunctious.
