Charlie now is at [Willoughby Croft](https://www.willoughbycroft.com/).

Charlie is one of those goats we didn't get around to freshening in a timely manner. She is a three year old first freshener, but what she lacks in number of freshenings she makes up for in genetics. You see Charlie's dam is a 5th generation doe to obtain her Superior Genetics. Charlie seems to have gotten her dam's lovely medial and soft easy to milk udder. 

Sire: Castle Rock Bugatti
Dam: SG Franke Farm PN Coach
